#1. declare operand_one and operand_two varable
#initializing eah to 0.0.

#2. declare the variables sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder,
#and initialize each to 0.0.

#3. prompt the user to input a real number as the first operand, assigning
#it to your operand_one variable

#4. prompt the user to input a real number as the second operand, assigning
#it to your operand_two variable

#5. Ask the user which operation they would like to have performed

#6. Calculate the result of the operation

#7. Output the result based on the user's choice. Include SIX decimal places for
#addition, subtraction, and multiplication and ZERo decimal places for division

#Hint: As before, for divison, use operand_one as the dividend and operand_two
#as the divisor
